# CASC Cheatsheet

Quick syntax lookup. See [CASC.md](CASC.md) for full explanations, or
the [tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) for a walkthrough.

## File skeleton

```casc
#@version = 1.0   ; required, must be the first non-blank/non-comment statement

# a line comment, runs to end of line

key = value        ; "=" is always optional -- "key value" works too
```

## Statements

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `key = value` / `key value` | assignment (§5.3) |
| `key { ... }` | block (sugar for `key = { ... }`, §5.4) |
| `a.b.c = value` | dotted path (sugar for nested blocks, §5.4) |
| `@name = value` | public variable declaration (§5.2) |
| `@*name = value` | private variable declaration -- file-local, never exported (§5.2) |
| `import "path"` | filesystem import, glob/brace patterns expand (§5.1) |
| `import "scheme://..."` | consumer-registered import loader (§5.1, §9.3) |
| `for ... as ... { ... }` | loop (§5.5) |
| `#statement` | disabled statement -- produces nothing (§5.6) |

## Sigil ordering (`#`, then `~`/`+`/`-`, then `*`, then the key)

| Sigil | Position | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `#key` | disable | statement produces nothing (§5.6) |
| `~key { ... }` | merge control | replace the whole subtree, not merge (§5.7/§8.4) |
| `+key = [...]` | merge control | append to an existing list (§5.7/§8.4) |
| `-key = [...]` | merge control | remove matching elements from an existing list (§5.7/§8.4) |
| `-key.path` | merge control | delete the path entirely, any type, no value (§5.7/§8.4) |
| `*key` | secrecy | mark this key (and everything under it) secret (§4.3) |

```casc
#~*database { host = "db.internal", password = "hunter2" }
```
`#` disabled, `~` replace, `*` secret, in that order, no separators.

## Values (§6)

| Syntax | Result |
|---|---|
| `nil` | `nil` |
| `true` / `false` | `true` / `false` |
| `-17`, `0`, `+99`, `0xDEAD_BEEF`, `0o755`, `0b1101`, `3.14`, `5e+22` | numbers, `_` allowed as a digit separator |
| `inf`, `+inf`, `-inf` | infinities |
| `info`, `:info` | atom `:info` (leading `:` optional except to reach a reserved word: `:true`, `:nil`, ...) |
| `"double quoted"` | string -- escapes + interpolation (§7) |
| `'single quoted'` | string -- literal, no escapes/interpolation |
| `"""triple\nquoted"""` | multi-line string, common leading whitespace stripped |
| `\` at end of line | backslash continuation -- joins onto the next line |
| `1979-05-27T07:32:00Z`, `1979-05-27`, `07:32:00` | date/time/datetime (§6.6) |
| `127.0.0.1`, `127.0.0.1/32`, `::1/128` | `%Cooper.IPv4{}` / `%Cooper.IPv6{}` (§6.7) |
| `500ms`, `1h30m` | `{:duration, nanoseconds}` -- units: `ns us µs ms s m h d`, descending, no repeats (§6.8) |
| `512MiB`, `10GB` | `{:bytes, count}` -- `Ki/Mi/Gi/Ti/Pi` = ×1024, no `i` = ×1000 (§6.9) |
| `["a", "b", "c"]` | list -- comma/newline/whitespace-separated |
| `(52.52, 13.405)` | tuple -- fixed arity, never merged, only replaced wholesale (§6.11) |

## Interpolation and references (§7)

| Sigil | Meaning | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| `@{name}` | variable reference (§7.1) | eager, per-file |
| `${NAME}` | environment variable, always a string (§7.2) | eager |
| `%{path}` | reference into the final merged tree (§7.3) | lazy, after merge |
| `!{resolver:payload}` | consumer-registered resolver dispatch (§7.4/§9.2) | resolve time |
| `!Name(arg)` | tagged value -- built-in or consumer-registered (§7.5/§9.1) | resolve time |

Shared suffix grammar across `@{}`/`${}`/`%{}`:

| Suffix | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `:default` | fall back to `default` if undefined/unset |
| `:+alt` | substitute `alt` if defined/set, else empty string |
| `:?"message"` | fail loading with `message` if undefined/unset |
| `[i]` | index into a list-valued variable/config path |

`${...}`-only extras:

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `${?NAME}` | guards the *one statement immediately following* -- skipped entirely if `NAME` unset/empty |
| `${NAME[]:[...]}` | parse `NAME` as a comma/semicolon-separated list, with a default |
| `${NAME[i]:default}` | index into the split list |

## Imports (§5.1)

`import "path.casc"` -- relative to the current file; brace/glob
patterns expand against the filesystem. A path may interpolate
`${NAME}`/`${NAME:default}` to select one:

```casc
import "env/${COOPER_ENV}.casc"
```

Only `${...}`; `%{...}` needs the finished tree, which does not exist
while the document is still being parsed. An unset variable with no
default is an error, not an empty segment.

The common shape is an entry document importing shared concerns and then
its environment's overlay, last so it overrides them:

```casc
import "inc/database.casc"
import "env/${COOPER_ENV}.casc"
```

Every selectable file must exist -- a missing import is a load error, so
keep an `env/prod.casc` even when it overrides nothing. Default to the
environment whose tooling does *not* set the variable, which is usually
`dev`: deployed environments set it explicitly.

## Filters (§7.2)

| Filter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `\| trim` | strip leading and trailing whitespace |
| `\| downcase`, `\| upcase` | change case |
| `\| trim_prefix: "..."`, `\| trim_suffix: "..."` | strip an affix if present |

One rule shared by `@{...}`, `${...}` and `%{...}`, exactly like the
suffix grammar. Applied after the suffix settles, left to right, so a
filter always sees the value that will actually be used:

```casc
scheme = ${SCHEME | trim_suffix: "://" | downcase}
region = ${REGION:"  us-east-1  " | trim}
```

Single-quoted arguments exist so a filter stays usable inside an
interpolated string: `"${S | trim_suffix: '://'}://%{host}"`. Filters
normalize, they never convert -- a non-string is an error, not a
coercion. Use a tagged value to change a type.

## Built-in tagged values

`!int(arg)` `!float(arg)` `!bool(arg)` `!duration(arg)` `!bytes(arg)`
`!trim(arg)` `!downcase(arg)` `!upcase(arg)` `!module(arg)` -- always
available, no registration needed. `!duration`/`!bytes` produce the same
`{:duration, ns}` / `{:bytes, n}` shape as the bare literal forms
(§6.8/§6.9); `!trim`/`!downcase`/`!upcase` normalize a whole value the
way the matching filter normalizes one reference; `!module("Foo.Bar")`
names a module, which §6.4's bare-identifier atoms cannot express.

## Loops (§5.5)

```casc
for <binding> [, <binding>]* [from <template-path>] as <destination-path> {
  <body>
}
```

| Binding | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `@name` | index binding -- current iteration number, at most one per loop, no `in` |
| `@name in <iterable>` | element binding -- current element of an `@{}`/`%{}`-resolved list |

- Multiple element bindings iterate **in parallel** (zipped by index), never a cartesian product -- all bound lists must share the same length.
- `from <template-path>` copies that path's value as each iteration's base, resolved lazily against the *final* tree, same timing as `%{...}`.
- `<destination-path>` may use interpolated segments built from the loop's own bindings.
- Loop-bound variables are scoped to the body only.

## Merge model (§8)

| Type | Default | Override |
|---|---|---|
| Blocks/maps | deep-merge | `~key { ... }` replaces the whole subtree |
| Lists | replace wholesale | `+key`/`-key` append/remove elements |
| Tuples | replace wholesale | none -- `~`/`+`/`-` against a tuple is a load-time error |

Later statements (including a later import) override earlier ones at
the same path. `%{...}` always resolves against the *final*, fully
merged tree, regardless of where in the source the reference itself
was written.

## Identifiers (§4.1)

`/^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_+-]*[?!]?$/` -- mixed case, `_`/`-`/`+`, digits,
optional trailing `?`/`!`. `nil`/`true`/`false`/`inf`/`+inf`/`-inf` are
reserved everywhere (§6.4); `for`/`in`/`from`/`as` are reserved only
inside a `for` statement (§5.5), ordinary identifiers everywhere else.
A key segment that doesn't fit this rule (spaces, punctuation) must be
quoted: `"Content-Type" = "application/json"`.

## Common gotchas

- `#TODO` (no space) is a **disabled-statement attempt**, not a
  comment -- it fails to parse unless `TODO` happens to be valid
  statement syntax. `# TODO` (space) is unambiguously a comment (§3.2).
- `${...}` always resolves to a plain string -- wrap it in `!int(...)`/
  `!bool(...)`/etc. to get a typed value; CASC never guesses a type
  from what the string looks like (§7.2).
- A compound duration (`1h30m`) requires strictly descending,
  non-repeated, integer-only components -- `30m1h` and `1.5h30m` are
  both invalid (§6.8).
- `+`/`-` against a **tuple** is a load-time error, not a silent no-op
  -- only lists support append/remove (§6.11/§8.3).
- `%{...}`/`@{...}` cycles are a load-time error naming the full cycle
  path, never an infinite loop or a silently partial value (§7.1/§7.3).
- An unregistered `!Name(...)` tag, `!{resolver:...}` resolver, or
  `scheme://` import source is always a load-time error naming the
  offender -- never silently ignored (§9.4).
